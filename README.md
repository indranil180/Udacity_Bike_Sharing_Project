# Udacity_Bike_Sharing_Project

This project is part of Udacity's nano degree project where i need to build a model for bike sharing prediction.
The forward pass and backward propagation was implemented along with the right hyperparameter selection which will help in buidling a
good model with less training & validation loss.
